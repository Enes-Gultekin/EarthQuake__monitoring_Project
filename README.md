Earthquake Monitoring Project

In this study, I decided to do a Single Web Application about displaying last earthquake events, deadliest earthquakes of each country since the last century and fault-lines. User can search for country in order to see earthquake events and the current location can be seen. User Interface is remained quite simple and plain. Preparing the web application, there are several applications and libraries were used. For the Front-End side, HTML-CSS-Javascript; PostrGreSql,php and apachi server was used at the Back-End side. Libraries that I used were Leaflet, Bootstrap and Pulsing Icons.
